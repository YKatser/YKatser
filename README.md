## Hi there, I'm Iurii Katser
Iâ€™m currently the Head of Data Science for Mining at [conundrum.ai](https://conundrum.ai). My professional and research interests focus on applying machine learning to industrial settings, with an emphasis on anomaly detection, technical diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and process control.

- ðŸ”© With over 8 years of experience across diverse industrial sectors (energy, metallurgy, mining, oil&gas), I specialize in developing ML-driven predictive maintenance (PdM) and optimization solutions.
- ðŸ”­ I lead an R&D team focused on advancing industrial AI, with a background in academic research, having completed a PhD thesis on (*Neural Network Based Algorithms of the Anomaly Detection in the Industrial Data Processing*).
- ðŸš€ For 5 years, I was a co-founder of [waico](https://github.com/waico), a startup dedicated to enhancing industrial processes through machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my expertise in process optimization, apc, mpc to strengthen my technical skillset.
- âš¡ My mission is to blend my engineering and ML background to help industrial companies achieve greater operational efficiency and increase revenue.
